Silk is a practical frontend to various slackware package management
tools, namely slackpkg, sbopkg, slapt-get, slapt-src.
It implements the more common commands and simplifies the operation
of both programs by unifying the syntax and their execution.

sbopkg is disabled by default, if you have it installed you can
enable it in the config file ~/.config/silkrc

Please add your user to sudoers in order to use the program.

command-line usage examples:

  sl u         --> update&upgrade installed programs and slackbuilds
  sl s 'name'  --> search for a package or slackbuild 'name'
  sl i 'name'  --> install 'name'
  sl r 'name   --> remove name

An launcher in installed in the programs menu that runs silk-shell,
which streamlines operations. In this case you can type the commands
directly at the "Silk>" prompt, for example:

    Silk> u

Note: 'sl' and 'slapt' are symlinks to 'silk'. Use them as aliases.
       This program conflicts with the 'sl' package found in
       SlackBuilds.org,do not install both at the same time.
